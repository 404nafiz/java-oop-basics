# Java OOP Concepts

This repository contains Java code files demonstrating various Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. Below is a brief explanation of each concept covered in the repository:

## 1. **Abstract Class and Method**
   - **Description**: This folder contains code demonstrating how abstract classes and methods work in Java. An abstract class cannot be instantiated and may contain abstract methods that must be implemented by subclasses.
## 2. **Constructor**
   - **Description**: This folder focuses on constructors in Java, which are special methods used to initialize objects. It demonstrates the use of default constructors and parameterized constructors.
## 3. **Function Parameter**
   - **Description**: Code in this folder shows how to pass parameters to functions in Java. It covers different types of parameters, including primitive types and object references.
## 4. **Inheritance**
   - **Description**: This folder demonstrates the concept of inheritance, where a class can inherit methods and properties from another class. It showcases how subclassing works and the use of the `extends` keyword.

## 5. **Instance Variables**
   - **Description**: The code here explains instance variables, which are non-static variables defined in a class. Each object created from the class has its own copy of these variables.

## 6. **Java Interface**
   - **Description**: This folder demonstrates Java interfaces, which define abstract methods that implementing classes must provide. It shows how interfaces are used to achieve abstraction and multiple inheritance.

## 7. **Method Overloading**
   - **Description**: Code in this folder explains method overloading in Java. Method overloading allows you to define multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists.
