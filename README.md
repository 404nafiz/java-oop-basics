# Java OOP Concepts

This repository contains Java code files demonstrating various Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. Below is a brief explanation of each concept covered in the repository:

## 1. **Abstract Class and Method** 🧑‍🏫
   - **Description**: This folder contains code demonstrating how abstract classes and methods work in Java. An abstract class cannot be instantiated and may contain abstract methods that must be implemented by subclasses.

## 2. **Constructor** 🏗️
   - **Description**: This folder focuses on constructors in Java, which are special methods used to initialize objects. It demonstrates the use of default constructors and parameterized constructors.

## 3. **Function Parameter** 🎛️
   - **Description**: Code in this folder shows how to pass parameters to functions in Java. It covers different types of parameters, including primitive types and object references.

## 4. **Inheritance** 🔄
   - **Description**: This folder demonstrates the concept of inheritance, where a class can inherit methods and properties from another class. It showcases how subclassing works and the use of the `extends` keyword.

## 5. **Instance Variables** 📝
   - **Description**: The code here explains instance variables, which are non-static variables defined in a class. Each object created from the class has its own copy of these variables.

## 6. **Java Interface** 🔌
   - **Description**: This folder demonstrates Java interfaces, which define abstract methods that implementing classes must provide. It shows how interfaces are used to achieve abstraction and multiple inheritance.

## 7. **Method Overloading** 🔂
   - **Description**: Code in this folder explains method overloading in Java. Method overloading allows you to define multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists.

## 8. **Project1** 🖥️
   - **Description**: This folder contains a project that applies multiple OOP concepts together in a real-world example. It provides practical implementation of OOP principles.

## 9. **Static Variables and Function** ⚙️
   - **Description**: This folder focuses on static variables and methods. Static members belong to the class itself rather than any instance, and they are shared across all objects of that class.

## 10. **Super Keyword** 🦸
   - **Description**: Code in this folder explains the use of the `super` keyword in Java. It demonstrates how to call methods or access fields of a superclass from a subclass.
