# Java OOP Concepts

This repository contains Java code files demonstrating various Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. Below is a brief explanation of each concept covered in the repository:

## 1. **Abstract Class and Method**
   - **Description**: This folder contains code demonstrating how abstract classes and methods work in Java. An abstract class cannot be instantiated and may contain abstract methods that must be implemented by subclasses.
## 2. **Constructor**
   - **Description**: This folder focuses on constructors in Java, which are special methods used to initialize objects. It demonstrates the use of default constructors and parameterized constructors.
## 3. **Function Parameter**
   - **Description**: Code in this folder shows how to pass parameters to functions in Java. It covers different types of parameters, including primitive types and object references.
